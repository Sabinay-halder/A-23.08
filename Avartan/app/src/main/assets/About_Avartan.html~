<h3 class="s2">ABOUT AVARTAN</h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Decades ago NITIE decided to take a step towards making a mark on the business school fraternity through the inception of such events as Prerana (circa. 1995), Lakshya (circa. 2000), Empresario(circa. 2004), Envision, and Litmus (circa. 2007). 2012 saw Envision and Litmus merge with Prerana.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
The prime objective of these festivals has always been to provide the much needed industry interface for the students. The events see participants from the best business schools of the country compete in competitions that span the entire gamut of management education. They also see phenomenal corporate participation and help in fostering managerial excellence by bringing students, faculty, and industry leaders onto a common platform.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
NITIE celebrates its golden jubilee in 2013 and would take a monumental step towards integrating all student events including the four aforementioned ones into a unified celebration. 2013 would see the genesis of Avartan – A grand celebration of NITIE’s vision of being the leader in the knowledge led productivity movement. The umbrella event would see the amalgamation of Prerana and Lakshya with the Entrepreneurship Cell - Empresario, the cultural festival – Denovo and the sports meet – Josh.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
Avartan refers to a rhythmic cycle of Indian music. Chosen as the name for the grand unification, it captures the essence of various events coming together in harmony to create a symphony that befits NITIE.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
Avartan would become a single platform for bridging the gap between classroom learning and the practical application in the real world. The event would see various academic, cultural, and sports competition coupled with conclaves and business meets. It would also play host to such events as Power talks, Cita-de-La Prerana, and Decibelz – NITIE’s rock night.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
The inspiration and drive remain the same – to foster managerial excellence and industrial productivity through inspiring solutions and practical innovations.</span></p>
